## questionQueue

questionQueue is a very simple web app built using PHP and the Laravel framework for the Vegan Hacktivists code challenge. Full details of the code challenge [are here.](https://gist.github.com/GRardB/7e2990bbea8c2e50e2b501b712d8c169)

### Summary of the challenge
The goal is to build a very, very simple Q&A website. A visitor should be able to ask questions and leave answers without any authentication. How you set up the routes and whatnot is up to you, but at the very least, the website should contain:
1. A page showing list of questions
2. A page to view one question, including its answers
3. Forms for submitting a question and an answer

### Goals of the project
1. Create a simple question and answer web app
2. Become more familiar with Laravel
3. Exhibit good coding practices

### Some stretch goals
1. Deploy completed app to Heroku
2. Write tests
